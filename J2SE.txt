J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition)

How Java Program works
======================
1. Write a doc file with .java extension like index.java
2. Insert the java code in this file.
3. Compile the file by using javac command (javac index.java)
4. After compilation it will generate .class file which is called byte code.
5. Now we need to execute the .class file (java class_name)
6. This .class file execute by the JVM.

JVM : Java Virtual Machine
 - JVM is library of JRE.
 - From byte code JVM will search for the specific file where the main method [public static void main(String[] args){} ] is written.

JRE : Java Runtime Environment.

JDK : Java Development Kit

JDK >> JRE >> JVM

Moto of Java : WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere)
